Hi, I am Sio from Vietnam. 

I enjoy web development and have a passion for cybersecurity. I particularly relish the fusion of both fields. Therefore, sometimes I work as a security engineer, and other times, I work as a web developer

I try to blog about my technology research.

In my spare time, I really like playing sports (Badminton), and playing ranked video games (LoL).
